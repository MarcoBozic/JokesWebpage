# JokesWebpage

My Purpose:

The purpose of this project was to gain an understanding of the fundamentals of web development along with how webpages interact with databases. From this project I was able to pick up and improve on
skills such as html, mySQL, jQuery, php, bootstrap, git, and many 
more. In the end, I am very proud of what I was able to accomplish 
and will continue to work on more interesting projects to learn
even more!

How It Works:

The user has two main pieces of functionality that they have access to; 
they can add their own jokes and answers, and they can search for jokes
with a specific keyword that is already in the database. As of now, the
website can run only on a local host(personal computer) but the  functionality would be very similar if I wanted to pay for hosting 
services.

Future Plans:

Although I am really pround with the outcome of this project, there are
always improvements that can be made! One of the reasons for not hosting
the webpage for the public is that there were very little security measures that were implemented. Since I am still not an expert on web 
development, I am not sure how to fully protect all the data contained
in the database and I do not know how to protect my webpage from nefarious attacks if it were to go public. In the end, my future goals
are to learn more about security and build upon the many foundations 
that I was able to pick up over these weeks.
